Python Movingpandas Trajectory Collection

As a movement specific library and object type, we have selected movingpandas trajectory collection as a first IO type for Python App in MoveApps. It is based on the widely used pandas and geopandas libraries, with a timestamp associated to each data item, in addition to the basic geopandas trajectory ID, coordinates and projection. Coming from R Apps, the translator is generating the trajectory collection from a csv of all event data an their projection and time zone.
