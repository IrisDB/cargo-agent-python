Python MovingPandas Trajectory Collection

As a movement specific library and object type, we have selected MovingPandas trajectory collection as a first IO (input/output) type for Python Apps in MoveApps. It is based on the widely used pandas and GeoPandas libraries, with a timestamp associated to each data item, in addition to the basic GeoPandas trajectory ID, coordinates and projection. Coming from R Apps, the translator App is generating the trajectory collection from a csv of all event data and their projection and time zone.
